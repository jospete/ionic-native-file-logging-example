# Ionic/Capacitor File-based Logging Example

This is a simple shell app that utilizes 
[@obsidize/rx-console](https://github.com/jospete/obsidize-rx-console)
and [@obsidize/rotating-file-stream](https://github.com/jospete/obsidize-rotating-file-stream)
to stream log events to a file using the cordova file plugin.

See the [LogManagerService](https://github.com/jospete/ionic-native-file-logging-example/blob/master/src/app/services/log-manager.service.ts)
implementation for relevant details.
