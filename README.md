# Ionic/Capacitor File-based Logging Example

This is a simple shell app that utilizes 
[@obsidize/rx-console](https://github.com/jospete/obsidize-rx-console)
and [@obsidize/rotating-file-stream](https://github.com/jospete/obsidize-rotating-file-stream)
to stream log events to a file using the cordova file plugin.
